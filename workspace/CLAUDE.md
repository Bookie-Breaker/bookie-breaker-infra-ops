# BookieBreaker — Shared Claude Configuration

## System Overview

BookieBreaker is a distributed sports prediction and paper trading system that identifies positive expected value (+EV)
betting edges against sportsbooks using hybrid prediction (Monte Carlo simulation + ML calibration). It supports NFL,
NBA, MLB, and NCAA leagues.

## Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous:** REST APIs between services (`/api/v1/{resource}`)
- **Asynchronous:** Redis pub/sub for events (fire-and-forget, no persistence)
- **Caching:** Redis with TTLs for stats, simulation results, dashboard data

### Event Channels

- `events:lines.updated` — Line changes detected
- `events:stats.updated` — Injury or stat updates
- `events:game.completed` — Game final scores
- `events:simulation.completed` — Simulation finished
- `events:prediction.completed` — Predictions generated
- `events:edge.detected` — Edge identified
- `events:bet.graded` — Paper bet graded

## Data Flow

```text
statistics-service → simulation-engine → prediction-engine → agent → bookie-emulator
                                                                ↑
lines-service ─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. statistics-service fetches team/player stats from external APIs
2. simulation-engine runs Monte Carlo simulations using those stats
3. prediction-engine calibrates probabilities with ML, adding contextual features
4. agent compares calibrated probabilities to market lines from lines-service
5. agent detects edges and places paper bets via bookie-emulator

## Data Ownership

| Entity                               | Owner              | Others Read Via |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Teams, Players, Games, Venues        | statistics-service | REST API        |
| Sportsbooks, BettingLines            | lines-service      | REST API        |
| SimulationConfigs, SimulationResults | simulation-engine  | REST API        |
| Predictions, Models, Features        | prediction-engine  | REST API        |
| Edges, Alerts, Analyses              | agent              | REST API        |
| PaperBets, BetGrades, Bankroll       | bookie-emulator    | REST API        |

## Database Architecture

- **PostgreSQL 16 + TimescaleDB** with schema-per-service: `lines`, `predictions`, `emulator`
- **Redis 7** for caching and pub/sub events
- Cross-service references use UUIDs only, never direct DB access

## Repository Layout

All 11 repos live under `BookieBreaker/`:

- Documentation: `bookie-breaker-docs/` (architecture, schemas, ADRs, operations)
- Infrastructure: `bookie-breaker-infra-ops/` (Docker Compose, CI/CD)
- Services: `bookie-breaker-{service}/` (each self-contained)

## Conventions

### Commits

Conventional Commits enforced by commitlint: `type(scope): description`
Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, perf, ci, build

### API Design

- All endpoints: `/api/v1/{resource}`
- Standard JSON envelope: `{ "data": ..., "meta": { "timestamp", "request_id" } }`
- UUID v4 for all identifiers
- Pagination via `?limit=&offset=`

### Tooling

- **mise** for tool version pinning (`.config/mise.toml`)
- **lefthook** for git hooks (`.config/lefthook.yml`)
- **go-task** for task automation (`Taskfile.yml`)
- **Renovate** for dependency updates (`renovate.json`)

### Testing

- `tests/unit/` — No external deps, fast
- `tests/integration/` — Real Postgres/Redis (testcontainers)
- `tests/e2e/` — Full service stack

### Environment Variables

- Set `MISE_CONFIG_FILE=.config/mise.toml` in your shell profile
- Set `LEFTHOOK_CONFIG=.config/lefthook.yml` in your shell profile
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` per repo for local dev

## Shared Commands

From `BookieBreaker/` root:

- `task bootstrap` — Install tools and hooks across all repos
- `task up` — Start full stack via Docker Compose
- `task down` — Stop all services
- `task build` — Build all containers
- `task test` — Run tests across all repos
- `task lint` — Lint all repos
- `task logs` — Aggregate logs

Per-repo:

- `task bootstrap` — Install tools and hooks for this repo
- `task dev` — Run with hot reload
- `task lint` — Run linters
- `task test` — Run tests

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.
Each repo owns a gitignored `graphify-out/` (built with `graphify extract <repo> --code-only`); the root
`graphify-out/graph.json` is the merge of all per-repo graphs and is the one to query.

Rules:

- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` from the workspace root when
  graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and
  `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller
  than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface
  enough context.
- Graphs update automatically: a lefthook post-commit hook queues the repo and a debounced runner re-extracts
  and re-merges (AST-only, no API cost). To force an update now run `task graph:update`; for a full rebuild run
  `task graph:build`. Do NOT run `graphify update .` at the workspace root — it would replace the merged graph
  with a monolithic rescan.
